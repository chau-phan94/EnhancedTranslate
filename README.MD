# AI-Enhanced Speech Recognition & Translation Platform

This internal project implements advanced AI-driven speech recognition and translation functionality using **SwiftUI**, **Swift Concurrency**, iOS's **Speech** framework, and cutting-edge AI translation models.

## Core AI Features

- **Advanced Speech Recognition**: State-of-the-art AI models for improved accuracy in noisy environments
- **Enterprise-grade Translation**: Secure, business-focused translation with support for industry-specific terminology
- **Accent Recognition**: Enhanced models to understand various accents and dialects
- **Meeting Context Awareness**: AI that understands conversation context for more accurate translations
- **Real-Time Transcription**: Converts audio to text.
## Technical Requirements

- iOS 16.0+
- Xcode 15.4+
- Swift 5.5+
- Access to secure translation APIs

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chauphan-94/EnhancedTranslation.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Xcode:
   ```bash
   cd EnhancedTranslation
   open SpeechToText.xcodeproj
   ```
3. Configure API keys in the configuration file (see documentation)
4. Run the project on a simulator or physical device.

## Enterprise Usage

1. Secure authentication with company credentials
2. Permissions management for sensitive communications
3. Press the "Start" button to begin recording, transcribing, and translating
4. View real-time translations with confidence scores
5. Export transcripts in multiple formats for business documentation

## Architecture

- **AI Processing Layer**: Handles speech recognition, language detection, and translation
- **SpeechToTextService**: Manages the core speech-to-text logic
- **TranslationService**: Processes text through secure translation APIs
- **ContextAnalysisEngine**: Improves translation accuracy based on conversation history
- **SpeechToTextViewModel**: Coordinates between AI services and the user interface
- **EnhancedUIComponents**: Business-focused interface built with SwiftUI
